<h3>Vim Settings and .bashrc</h3>
<p>
This repository was created as a backup and quick get for my Vim settings and for my .bashrc. I have some nice features added that you can find below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Switching Tabs = Ctrl-] or Ctrl-\</li>
  <li>Default Colorscheme = Distinguished</li>
  <li>Added SnipMate</li>
  <li>Added EasyMotion</li>
  <li>Added Sparkup</li>
  <li>Added Surround</li>
</ul>
<p>
Included colorschemes are: distinguished, railcasts, solarized, guardian
</p>

<h3>The .bashrc file includes nice aliases like:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>lsa = ls -all</li>
  <li>
  cls = clear</li>
  <li>webroot = {this is a weird one only for the testing server I'm useing}</li>
  <li>PRMTest = {again, only for current testing server}</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think the vim files will definitely be helpful to some though.
